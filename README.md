## aframe-slideshow

A component to place slides as 3D frames and navigate through them.

- Navigation possible through Rift controllers (trigger to move forward, back trigger to move back) or arrow keys.
- Gamepad (fixed ID) is used to move an asset.
- Transitions are optional (e.g. here only on 2 slides).
- in VR mode it is possible draw over slides using apainter then switch back to the slides

This was used during the DevFestLille June 2017 by Thomas Balouet ([@thomasbalou](https://twitter.com/thomasbalou)) and Fabien Benetou ([@utopiah](https://twitter.com/utopiah/))
